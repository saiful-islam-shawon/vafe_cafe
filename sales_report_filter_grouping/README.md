## Courier Integration

### How it Works with delivery_courier_custom Module

The Vape Status field automatically integrates with the `delivery_courier_custom` module:

**Workflow:**
1. **Quotation**: Order is in draft/sent state
2. **Sales Order**: Order is confirmed, delivery order created
3. **Send to Courier**: When you click "Send Courier" button in delivery order
   - Delivery state changes to `courier_assigned`
   - Vape Status automatically updates to "Send to Courier"
   - Customer receives email notification
4. **Done (Delivered)**: When delivery is marked as delivered or validated
   - Delivery state changes to `done`
   - Vape Status automatically updates to "Done (Delivered)"

**Benefits:**
- Real-time status updates across sales and delivery
- No manual status updates needed
- Complete visibility of order lifecycle
- Integrated email notifications

**Without delivery_courier_custom:**
The module still works normally, tracking delivery based on standard Odoo picking states.
